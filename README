This is a full stack application.
It's purpose is to use user input to present info and stats on European countries.
It utilizes front-end JavaScript RESTapi and back-end PHP and SQL database.
front-end and back-end work seamlessly on the same page.
API presents general country information, displays the flag, coat of arms and the UN flag (if the country is a member of the UN)
PHP pulls SQL database and dynamically builds a html table with stats on the country's population changes since year 2000

to make this app work for you, you'll need to set up local SQL database, run database.php once and then run insert.php to fill in the database.
Afterwards, run index.php and you'll be all set!
